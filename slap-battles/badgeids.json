Before the accident, bob was temporarily inactive. The only species left by the terror, roaming in anarchy, yet all united under the goal of finding a way to stop the beast before it's too late. The strongest group, calling themselves the \"opposition\", owned a small research facility, hidden deep underground. They would research, and do countless experiments to learn more about how bob works, his traits and most importantly; how to combat him. The opposition would conduct experiments to attempt replication of a docile version of bob. A version that they could control. Hundreds of experiments, yet none seem to be able to replicate the power of him. Hope is not lost, as a member returns to the facility with a sample of dark blob matter which they presume some lost tissue belonging to bob. They extract the DNA and experiment with it.
